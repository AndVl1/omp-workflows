# Changelog

All notable changes to `omp-workflows` are documented here.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Workspace monorepo with two npm packages:
  - `@omp-workflows/core` — engine, gates, slash commands, profiles, artifact schemas.
  - `@omp-workflows/fullstack` — default bundle: 15 agents + 32 skills, pulls core as peer.
- Public API: `registerTeamWorkflow(pi, opts)` for bundles to wire the engine.
- Built-in default role/model/scope/flag presets exported as `defaultFullstackRoles`, `defaultFullstackModels`, `defaultFullstackScopeMap`, `defaultFullstackFlags`.
- Slash commands: `/team`, `/pulse`, `/init-team`, `/team-next`, `/team-yolo`, `/interview`, `/coordinator-stats`. Subset-selectable via `commands:` option.
- Gates as event handlers: `before_agent_start` (classification + monotonic), `session_stop` (DoD backstop), `tool_call` (safety).
- 8 declarative JSON profiles (`full-feature`, `standard`, `lightweight`, `debug-cycle`, `bug-fix`, `emergency`, `research`, `review`) and typed artifact schemas.
- 15 agents and 32 domain skills in the fullstack bundle.
- Smoke tests for the package split (9 tests, all passing).

### Changed

- Replaced the single-package layout with a workspace split. The legacy `commands/team.md` (830-line prose interpreter) is now TypeScript in `core/src/`. The bash hooks (`validate-state.sh`, `dod-gate.sh`, `safety-guard.sh`) are now event handlers in `core/src/gates/`.
- `DoD artifact shape` extended: `dod.items.length === 0` now blocks done-claim (previously passed).

### Migration notes

- Custom bundles: write `your-package/src/index.ts` with `registerTeamWorkflow(pi, { roles: ..., ... })`. See `packages/core/README.md` for the public API.
- Profile data is unchanged from `claude-plugin` v3.0.x — same JSON files, same `.work-state/` layout.
- Engine boot: `npm install` at the workspace root resolves both packages and creates symlinks under `node_modules/@omp-workflows/`.
