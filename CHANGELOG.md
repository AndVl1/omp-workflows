# Changelog

All notable changes to `omp-workflows` are documented here.

## [0.6.0] — 2026-08-01
### Added
- **`session_start` extension hook** in `@andvl1/omp-workflows-fullstack`. The extension now listens for `session_start` and calls `ensureCommandsForSession(projectRoot)`, copying any missing shipped commands into `<project>/.omp/commands/` on the fly without overwriting user-modified files. This covers the `omp plugin install` path where npm's `postinstall` does not fire (the package lives in `~/.omp/plugins/`, outside the project's `node_modules`). Together with the existing `postinstall`, slash command bootstrap now works for both `npm install` and `omp plugin install` — first OMP session in each project materialises `/do-work` and the rest automatically.
- **`packages/fullstack/src/copy-commands.ts`** — shared helper module exporting `copyCommandsForInstall` (force-copy, used by the `postinstall` script and the CLI) and `ensureCommandsForSession` (skip-existing, used by the `session_start` hook). Both tested via a new `packages/fullstack/test/copy-commands.test.ts`.
- **New unit tests**: 5 fresh fullstack tests covering shipped-dir resolution, fresh-project population, idempotency, user-edit preservation, and the install-time force-copy path. Test count: 11 in fullstack (was 6).

### Changed
- README has a new *Slash command bootstrap — works for both install paths* subsection and a trimmed *Bootstrap custom-TS commands* subsection reflecting that bootstrap is now automatic; the `npx omp-workflows-copy-commands` script remains available for explicit re-sync from source.

## [0.5.0] — 2026-08-01
### Added
- **`/do-work` command** alongside `/team` (alias). `/team` is now a thin alias for backwards compatibility; new code should use `/do-work`. Both commands share one implementation — `commands/team/index.ts` delegates to `commands/do-work/index.ts`.
- **`postinstall` hook** in `@andvl1/omp-workflows-fullstack`: copies slash commands into the consuming project's `.omp/commands/` automatically after `npm install`. Manual `npm run copy-commands` is no longer required.
- **`fullstack: parseEnvelope falls back to branch=null outside a git work tree`** unit test (mkdtempSync under `os.tmpdir()`). New fullstack coverage: 6/6 tests including alias delegation and the no-git fallback.
- **Fix CI verification** on `fullstack` — added the missing `"test"` npm script so `npm test` resolves from the workspace root.

### Changed
- **Graceful fallback when not inside a git work tree**: the workflow prompt renders `Branch: (no git work tree)` instead of erroring out, so `/do-work` works in fresh sandboxes and unrelated projects.
- Help copy in `pulse`, `team-next`, `team-yolo`, `interview`, `coordinator-stats` points at `/do-work`; `/team` is mentioned as an alias.
## Unreleased [legacy] — initial release notes
- **OMP custom-TS slash commands** shipped from the fullstack bundle:
  `/team`, `/pulse`, `/team-next`, `/team-yolo`, `/init-team`, `/interview`,
  `/coordinator-stats`. Each lives in `packages/fullstack/commands/<name>/index.ts`
  and is loaded by OMP from `.omp/commands/<name>/index.ts` after install.
- `copy-commands.mjs` (also exposed as the `omp-workflows-copy-commands`
  binary) — copies the bundled commands into `.omp/commands/` of the
  consuming project. Run once after install.
- `createTaskCaller(tool: TaskToolLike)` exported from
  `@andvl1/omp-workflows-core` — wraps the real OMP `TaskTool`
  (`@oh-my-pi/pi-coding-agent/task`) and exposes the `call`/`batch` API
  the engine consumes. Tests cover the wire contract.
- Test suite: 15 core + 5 fullstack tests (was 11); new coverage for
  `createTaskCaller` and the `/team` command envelope.

### Changed

- **Breaking**: `registerTeamWorkflow(pi, opts)` no longer calls
  `pi.registerCommand` for any of the 7 slash commands. The extension
  side only registers gates (`before_agent_start`, `session_stop`,
  `tool_call`) and writes runtime config. Slash commands ship as OMP
  custom-TS commands.
- `TaskCaller` interface now mirrors the real OMP `TaskTool` wire shape:
  `call({ agent, task, name?, effort? })` and `batch({ context, tasks[] })`.
  Old in-house `TaskCaller` shape is gone.
- `CORE_ENGINE_MARKER` exported for downstream bundles to detect that
  the engine was wired in.
- `tasks` enumerated in `packages/fullstack/package.json#files` so the
  commands and `copy-commands.mjs` script are published to npm.

### Migration notes

- Run `npm run --prefix node_modules/@andvl1/omp-workflows-fullstack copy-commands`
  (or `npx omp-workflows-copy-commands`) after install to bootstrap the
  slash commands into `.omp/commands/`. Without this step, the extension
  still wires gates, but the slash commands are missing.
- `commands:` option on `registerTeamWorkflow` is preserved for backward
  compatibility but is now a no-op (the extension doesn't register
  commands anyway). Remove it from your bundle config.

## [0.3.1] - 2026-08-01
## [0.3.0] - 2026-08-01

### Added

- Workspace monorepo with two npm packages:
  - `@omp-workflows/core` — engine, gates, slash commands, profiles, artifact schemas.
  - `@omp-workflows/fullstack` — default bundle: 17 agents + 31 skills, pulls core as peer.
- Public API: `registerTeamWorkflow(pi, opts)` for bundles to wire the engine.
- Built-in role/scope/flag presets exported as `defaultFullstackRoles`, `defaultFullstackScopeMap`, `defaultFullstackFlags`.
- Slash commands: `/team`, `/pulse`, `/init-team`, `/team-next`, `/team-yolo`, `/interview`, `/coordinator-stats`. Subset-selectable via `commands:` option.
- Gates as event handlers: `before_agent_start` (classification + monotonic), `session_stop` (DoD backstop), `tool_call` (safety).
- 8 declarative JSON profiles (`full-feature`, `standard`, `lightweight`, `debug-cycle`, `bug-fix`, `emergency`, `research`, `review`) and typed artifact schemas.
- 17 agents and 31 domain skills in the fullstack bundle.
- Smoke tests for the package split and OMP-native role dispatch.
- Pull-request CI for reproducible install, build, typecheck, and tests.

### Changed

- Replaced the single-package layout with a workspace split. The legacy `commands/team.md` (830-line prose interpreter) is now TypeScript in `core/src/`. The bash hooks (`validate-state.sh`, `dod-gate.sh`, `safety-guard.sh`) are now event handlers in `core/src/gates/`.
- `DoD artifact shape` extended: `dod.items.length === 0` now blocks done-claim (previously passed).
- Migrated subagent selection to OMP-native roles: workflows now resolve only role → agent, while agent frontmatter selects `@smol` / `@task` / `@slow` and native reasoning levels.
- Removed the workflow-level `models` map and Claude-specific `haiku` / `sonnet` / `opus` routing; concrete model assignment now belongs to OMP `modelRoles` or `task.agentModelOverrides`.

### Migration notes

- Custom bundles: write `your-package/src/index.ts` with `registerTeamWorkflow(pi, { roles: ..., ... })`. See `packages/core/README.md` for the public API.
- Profile data is unchanged from `claude-plugin` v3.0.x — same JSON files, same `.work-state/` layout.
- Engine boot: `npm install` at the workspace root resolves both packages and creates symlinks under `node_modules/@omp-workflows/`.
