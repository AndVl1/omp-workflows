**🚫 Delegate, don't DIY.** Your first action for this stage is the Task call(s). Do NOT read code / run git / grep yourself "to give the agent context" — the agent gathers its own context. Recon-before-delegate is how the orchestrator absorbs the task and the subagent never runs.

Launch the **diagnostics** agent to find the root cause before any code change.

```
Agent (diagnostics):
"Investigate: [error description / stacktrace / expected-vs-actual].
 Run the 5-phase diagnostic workflow:
 1. Static analysis of relevant code
 2. System commands (build, logs, tests)
 3. Add temporary debug instrumentation
 4. Runtime analysis
 5. Localize root cause with a proposed fix"
```

**Root-cause gate (`root_cause_documented`) — MANDATORY before implementation:**

- Write `diagnosis.root_cause` to `.work-state/artifacts/diagnosis.json`: **what** the root
  cause is and **why** the proposed fix closes it rather than masking the symptom.
- Do at least **2 iterations** of repro/log evidence before proposing the fix.
- This directly answers the "опять мимо" (fix-the-symptom) failure mode. A PreToolUse(Edit)
  reminder nudges this for BUG_FIX tasks.

**Produces**: `diagnosis` (root_cause, evidence, proposed_fix, verification_checklist) and
`dod` (the Definition of Done — for a bug, minimum items: root cause named; repro-before
reproduces; repro-after does not; affected scenario checked in manual-qa). See
`workflows/artifacts-schema.json`.
