**🚫 Delegate, don't DIY.** Your first action for this stage is the Task call to the `manual-qa`
agent. Do NOT drive the app / Chrome / device yourself.

### PHASE 6.7: MANUAL QA — sequenced, on the FIXED code

**NOT UI-only.** This is manual *runtime* verification: observe the shipping code actually running.
The mode depends on scope:

| scope | mode | how manual-qa verifies |
|-------|------|------------------------|
| `scope.has_ui` (frontend/mobile) | **ui** | drive the real UI via agent-browser (web) / claude-in-mobile (app); screenshot + console + network |
| backend / CLI / service (no UI) | **runtime** | run the app/binary, hit endpoints (`curl`), read logs/output, check exit codes |

**Skip when**: `!scope.has_runtime` — i.e. there is nothing to run (pure docs/config/research
change). The interpreter skips the stage only then; a backend-only task is **not** skipped.

**Why sequenced (v3.0):** manual QA runs **after `review_fixes`**, so it exercises exactly the
code that will ship. Its evidence then feeds `qa_tests`, which encodes what was observed into
durable automated tests.

**Input**: the `review` (fixes applied), `implementation`, `architecture`, and — when present —
`feature_spec.acceptance_criteria` (use it as the checklist).

**Actions**:

1. Launch the manual-qa agent:
   ```
   Agent (manual-qa):
   "Manually verify the shipped change at RUNTIME against the acceptance criteria.

    Inputs:
    - feature_spec.acceptance_criteria (if present) — each is a pass/fail check
    - architecture + implementation — what changed and where

    Pick the mode from scope:
    - UI (has_ui): drive the real UI (agent-browser for web / claude-in-mobile for the app);
      screenshot each criterion and state WHAT IS VISIBLE; check console + network.
    - RUNTIME (no UI): run the app/binary; hit the affected endpoints/commands
      (curl, CLI invocation); capture the actual responses/exit codes and the
      relevant log lines.

    For each criterion record concrete evidence. Check for regressions in adjacent flows.

    Produce the `manual_qa` artifact (schema `manual_qa`):
    - verdict: PASS only if every criterion was observed working at runtime
    - mode: ui | runtime
    - evidence: array of concrete observations (screenshot+what's visible, or curl+response+logs)
    - regressions: anything pre-existing that broke (empty if none)
    - dod_additions: acceptance criteria to append to dod.json (source: manual_qa)"
   ```

2. Write `.work-state/artifacts/manual_qa.json`.

**Gate** (`manual_qa.verdict != FAIL`): a `FAIL` verdict blocks progress — loop back to
`review_fixes`/implementation with the failing evidence, or escalate to the user. A missing
verdict is treated as FAIL (never auto-pass).

**Feeds**: `qa_tests` consumes `manual_qa.evidence`; `summary` consumes the verdict.

### DoD fan-in (source: manual_qa)

**Append** acceptance criteria you verified — for UI include *what must be visible on the
screenshot*; for runtime include *the endpoint/command + expected response/log* — via the
`manual_qa` artifact `dod_additions[]` (which the orchestrator merges into `dod.json` with
`source: "manual_qa"`), and **close** items you verified with the observation as evidence.
Bump `updated_at`. See `commands/team.md` § Multi-source fan-in.
